    "  Creating suitable test data is crucial, but not always trivial. It should be extensive enough to cover all functional requirements and yet as small as possible in order to save resources, both in space and time.\n",
    "* __Code execution__ \\\n",
    "  The main goal of a test is to find bugs _before_ the user encounters them. Ultimately every single line of the program should be subject to test.\\\n",
    "  In order to achieve this, it is necessary to run the code with respect to the whole parameter space. In practice that means that even a simple method may require a lot of test code.\\\n",
    "  (Bear this in mind when designing methods of functions: <i style=\"color:darkred;\">the number of parameters increases the number of required tests exponentially!</i>)\n",
    "* __Result validation__ \\\n",
    "  After the code was executed the _actual_ result is compared to the _expected_ result. The expected result depends on test data, state and parametrization.\\\n",
    "  Therefore result validation can be very extensive. It most cases won't be practical to validate every single byte. Nevertheless attention should be paid to validate a range of results that is wide enough to discover as many thinkable discrepancies as possible."
